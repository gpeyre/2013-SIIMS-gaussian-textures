	by Gauss-Markov models, and infer the model parameters as well as
	the boundary of the regions in a variational optimization framework.
	Numerical results demonstrate that ?in contrast to purely texture-based
	segmentation schemes ?our method is effective in segmenting regions
	that differ in their dynamics even when spatial statistics are identical.}

	visual process which gives the immediate impression of two distinct
	fields. The condition for such discrimination was found to be based
	primarily on clusters or lines formed by proximate points of uniform
	brightness. A similar rule of connectivity with hue replacing brightness
	was obtained by using varicolored dots of equal subjective brightness.
	The limitations in discriminating complex line structures were also

@article{Oppenheim81,
    abstract = {In the Fourier representation of signals, spectral magnitude and phase tend to play different roles and in some situations many of the important features of a signal are preserved if only the phase is retained. Furthermore, under a variety of conditions, such as when a signal is of finite length, phase information alone is sufficient to completely reconstruct a signal to within a scale factor. In this paper, we review and discuss these observations and results in a number of different contexts and applications. Specifically, the intelligibility of phase-only reconstruction for images, speech, and crystallograph
    ic structures are illustrated. Several approaches to justifying the relative importance of phase through statistical arguments are presented, along with a number of informal arguments suggesting reasons for the importance of phase. Specific conditions under which a sequence can be exactly reconstructed from phase are reviewed, both for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional sequences, and algorithms for both approximate and exact reconstruction of signals from phase information are presented. A number of applications of the observations and results in this paper are suggested.},
